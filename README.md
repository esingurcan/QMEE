# QMEE
This repository is created for BIO 708: QMEE (Winter 2026) assignments, projects, and course duties.

Week 1 - Assignment 
I used the iris dataset, which is a built-in dataset in the R environment. It is a dataframe that includes the iris sepals and petals measurements. I used this dataset because that was the
dataframe I practiced a lot working with when I was learning basic R coding. I used this for the first week of the assignment, as I had not decided on my data for the semester yet (I will
change later and will follow the same steps for that data). 

Data context:
This dataset includes petal and sepal length and width measurements for three iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It contains 150 observations, with 50 observations per species,
and has no missing values. Descriptive statistics and a data dictionary are included in this project.

The biological questions I aim to explore with this data are:
1) Are there species-based differences in petal and sepal measurements? If so, which species has the longest petals, and which has the widest petals? (presented in both boxplots and
2) calculations)
3) Are petal measurements associated with sepal length and width?
4) Does petal length predict sepal length, and does this relationship depend on species?
5) Does petal width predict sepal width, and does this relationship depend on species?

Calculations:
This first project includes: (1) data exploration (e.g., summary statistics and the first and last few rows of the data); (2) a data dictionary describing each column with basic descriptive
statistics; (3) boxplots depicting petal and sepal measurements by species using a colorblind-friendly palette, with species comparisons and statistical significance added; and (4) basic
statistical analyses, including normality tests, skewness, kurtosis, Q–Q plots, ANOVA comparisons among species, correlations between petal and sepal measurements for each species, and simple
and linear mixed-effects regression analyses with interactions to address research questions 3 and 4.
